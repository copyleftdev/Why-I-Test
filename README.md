**Why Testing Became My Chosen Career**

My innate curiosity and creative drive were evident even in my childhood. I frequently dismantled phones, radios, and old TVs, striving to understand their inner mechanics. Beginning at the grassroots level, I started in technical support, where I honed my skills in listening, problem-solving, and translating complex concepts for those without a technical background. This role also cultivated my empathy for customers, allowing me to truly comprehend their feelings and frustrations.

This deep understanding of products and their end-users prompted the QA department to approach me. Initially, they offered me an analyst position. However, it was the training session with James Bach that became a game-changer. His compelling philosophy on testing resonated with me deeply, and I emerged from that session with clarity about my career path.

While I gravitated towards automation, I never neglected the value of exploratory testing. Recognizing that not every aspect can be automated, I devised tests to handle the more monotonous parts, freeing me to delve deeper into heuristic testing. Over time, I've mastered various disciplines, from security testing to devops, employing them all to thoroughly understand and test systems.

Despite suggestions to venture into roles like security engineering or devops engineering, I've remained steadfast in my commitment to testing. I firmly believe in its immense valueâ€”it's not just about ensuring the product's integrity, but also about safeguarding the company's reputation and, most crucially, protecting the end-user.

A distinct advantage I bring to any project is my keen interest in understanding the user: their industry, workflow, and unique needs. I often immerse myself in support calls and review support tickets. This approach has offered me invaluable insights, whether empathizing with a frustrated grandmother or comprehending the needs of a legal team preparing for trial. By embodying the user, I can craft and conduct tests that truly matter.
